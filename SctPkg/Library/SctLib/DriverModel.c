Routine Description:

  Intialize a driver by installing the Driver Binding Protocol onto the
  driver's DriverBindingHandle.  This is typically the same as the driver's
  ImageHandle, but it can be different if the driver produces multiple
  DriverBinding Protocols.  This function also initializes the EFI Driver
  Library that initializes the global variables tST, tBS, tRT.

Arguments:

  ImageHandle         - The image handle of the driver

  SystemTable         - The EFI System Table that was passed to the driver's entry point

  DriverBinding       - A Driver Binding Protocol instance that this driver is producing

  DriverBindingHandle - The handle that DriverBinding is to be installe onto.  If this
                        parameter is NULL, then a new handle is created.

Returns:

  EFI_SUCCESS is DriverBinding is installed onto DriverBindingHandle

  Otherwise, then return status from tBS->InstallProtocolInterface()
